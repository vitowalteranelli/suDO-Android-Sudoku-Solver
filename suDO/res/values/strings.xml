    <string name="hello_fourth">Nope, i\'m not perfect. It\'s possible that you can find detection mistakes. \n People think i\'m perfect SO DON\'T say anything about it. \n Otherwise.. It was your guilt, no doubts!</string>
    <string name="hello_fifth">Yeah, your boring Sudoku was solved. Now you owe me a coffee. (Didn\'t i say it?)  You should, you have, you MUST offer me a coffee. </string>
